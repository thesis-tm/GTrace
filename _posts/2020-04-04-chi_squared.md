We have learned previously that a variable $X_i$ following normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ can be converted into standard normal distribution i.e. normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$, using the following transformation, 

\begin{equation}
\frac{X_i-\mu}{\sigma} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
\end{equation}
