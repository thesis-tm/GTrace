Poisson's distribution is a probability distribution used to simulate the probability (or possibility) of happening some (discrete) events. For example, probability of $x$ number of accidents in a city. It is important to understand that the event are discrete $i.e.$ either they happen or do not happen, there is no middle state. Thus, the events are counted in discrete numbers like $1, 2,..., n$.
